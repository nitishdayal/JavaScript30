## About

Build 30 things in 30 days with vanilla JavaScript; no frameworks, libraries, etc. 
  Pacing is totally up to the individual; if you feel like knocking out 30 challenges
  in 30 minutes, hey, more power to you, but that would miss the point of this course (IMO).
  The idea behind these exercises is to utilize small amounts of what would regularly be
  'downtime' as moments in which we can build on our knowledge through some simple
  exercises. My goal is to _participate_ in 3 challenges per day (watch the videos, take 
  some notes, etc.) and to _complete_ one challenge per day.

The starter files include solutions to most challenges, so this isn't really meant to be 
  taken as some kind of competition or something. JavaScript30 appears to be focused more on
  helping developers enhance their current skillset and reducing developer reliance on external
  JS libraries; **if it can be done with a JS library, it can (probably) be done with vanilla JS.**
