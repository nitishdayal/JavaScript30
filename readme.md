This repository contains my written guides for the JavaScript30 course by
  [Wes Bos](//github.com/wesbos). I wrote these in the hopes of expanding the ways
  in which people can access this course; not everyone has the data allotments
  or internet speeds or...whatever the case may be to load multiple high definition
  videos. Or, maybe, you prefer to have a text-based guide to follow along with/
  refer back to. Orrr you're in a library and don't have headphones. Who knows! If
  you want some documentation to go along with those sweet Wes Bos vids, here you go.

**DISCLAIMER:** My approach to some of the challenges will vary from the provided answers (found in
  the files that end with `-FINISHED` on the main repo). Some of the tweaks are just to
  include various 'best practices' and some have huge chunks of differences. I try to provide
  thorough explanations when I do stray from the path and explain why I chose to do so, but
  I want to make it clear that some of these guides don't go hand-in-hand with the videos.

## About

Build 30 things in 30 days with vanilla JavaScript; no frameworks, libraries, etc. 
  Pacing is totally up to the individual; if you feel like knocking out 30 challenges
  in 30 minutes, hey, more power to you, but that would miss the point of this course (IMO).
  The idea behind these exercises is to utilize small amounts of what would regularly be
  'downtime' as moments in which we can build on our knowledge through some simple
  exercises.

I think it's fair to say that, coming into this course, you should have a decent grasp
  of JavaScript fundamentals. Comfort when working with functions, callbacks, arrays,
  and objects will help a great deal in working through the challenges. If you don't,
  **don't worry and do it anyways** &lt;3. It might take you more than downtime to complete
  a challenge, but given that these exercises require you to work with those very topics
  time and time again, JavaScript30 is still an excellent learning resource.

The starter files (available [here](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30)) include solutions to 
  most challenges, so this isn't really meant to be taken as some kind of competition. 
  JavaScript30 is focused more on helping developers enhance their current skillset and 
  reducing developer reliance on external JS libraries; **if it can be done with a JS library, 
  it can (probably) be done with vanilla JS.**
